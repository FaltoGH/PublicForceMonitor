# [typicalPrice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typical_price)
In financial trading, typical price (sometimes called the pivot point) refers
to the arithmetic average of the high, low, and closing prices for a given
period.

Typical Price = ( H + L + C ) / 3

For example, consider a period of one day. If the high for that day was 1.2200,
the low was 1.2080, and the closing price was 1.2150, then the typical price
for that day would be:

TP = (1.2200 + 1.2080 + 1.2150)/3 = 1.2143.

In ForceMonitor, it is used in calculating LBB(Lower Bollinger Band).
